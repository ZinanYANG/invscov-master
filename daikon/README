This is a patched version of Daikon that provides the RunCorpus command.
Written by Andrea Fioraldi <andreafioraldi@gmail.com>

Usage:

java -cp $DAIKONDIR/daikon.jar daikon.RunCorpus --invs <textual output file> \
  --cmd './program <args...>' --corpus <corpus directory> <decls file>

If your program takes a filename in the arguments as input, replace it with @@,
otherwise the tool assumes that the input is taken via stdin.

The name of the dtrace file that the program has to produce is passed in the
DAIKON_DTRACE_FILE environment variable. Make sure that your frontend follows
this rule.

Temporary dtrace files are written in the current directory, you problably may
want to use an in-memory filesystem.
